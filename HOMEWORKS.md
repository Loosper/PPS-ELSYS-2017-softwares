# Homework 2

Create Pull Request with files `class{C}/{number in class}/homework2/task1.{ext}` and `class{C}/{number in class}/homework2/task2.{ext}`
until 23:55 UTC +2 of 23.11.2017.

Where {C} is the class letter A or B, {ext} is the proper file extention for the programming language in which you coded the task.

For this course recommended languages are Matlab, Octave, Python and Haskell. We will focus on Matlab. You can use any programming language for this homework
(you can use different languages for the different tasks).

Task 3 you have to write on paper and submit on next lesson (05/06.12.2017). Or you can code it in LaTex/Tex and submit via pull request with file
`class{C}/{number in class}/homework2/task3.tex` until 23:55 UTC +2 of 05.12.2017.

# Homework 3

Homework 3 must be submitted in the beginning of the lesson on:
